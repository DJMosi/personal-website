<h2 align="center">About my City</h2>

<p>Nairobi is the main commercial and cultural center for East Africa. It is the largest city between Cairo, Egypt, in north Africa, and Johannesburg, South Africa. Located on the edge of the rich agricultural region of the Central Highlands, Nairobi is the capital city of Kenya, the most developed country in East Africa. As one of Africa ' s leading cities, it hosts important international conferences and is the home for many embassies, international organizations, and businesses. The city has a cosmopolitan flair that combines African, Asian, European, and Middle Eastern cultures. Although it is a relatively new city (founded in 1899), it has played an important role in the region. It was at the epicenter of the nationalist movement, which eventually led to Kenya ' s independence from Great Britain in 1963. Since independence, the city has grown at a tremendous rate. The city reflects the stark contrasts of wealth that characterize Kenyan society. In the shadows of the skyscrapers in the prosperous and efficient central business district lives an army of up to 100,000 homeless. Side by side with beautiful upscale neighborhoods, like Karen and Westlands, are desolate slum areas, such as Mathare Valley and Kibera. The grinding poverty of some of the city ' s residents, coupled with the world-class wealth of others, has contributed to one of the Nairobi ' s most serious problems: crime. Muggings, car jackings, and robberies are common. However, for many residents the " City in the Sun " remains a dynamic and bustling place in which to live, work, and go to school.</p>
